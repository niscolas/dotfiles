# üå≤ Welcome to my .dotfiles üå≤

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Archived in favor of [my Nix based config - nyx](https://github.com/niscolas/nyx/tree/main)

These are my `Linux` (probably works on `MacOS` too) .dotfiles 

## üí≠ Inspiration

My main inspiration for this dotfiles setup was from [this other dotfiles repo](https://github.com/rockyzhang24/dotfiles/blob/master/README.md), so for installation and for doing a similar setup, checkout this repo!

I've also followed this [DT Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM) talking about the same topic.
